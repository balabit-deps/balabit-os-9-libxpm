Subject: [PATCH libXpm 7/7] Avoid CVE-2023-43787 (integer overflow in
 XCreateImage)

This doesn't fix the CVE - that has to happen in libX11, this
just tries to avoid triggering it from libXpm, and saves time
in not pretending we can successfully create an X Image for
which the width * depth would overflow the signed int used to
store the bytes_per_line value.
